     	<p>
     		Hampi was the capital of the Vijayanagar empire around 1500 AD, and by some accounts, the second largest city in the world at that time. Over the next centuries it fell out of importance, and now you can explore the ruins of a lot of temples and other structures spread out over a vast area. The terrain around Hampi is as mysterious as the ruins itself - the city is surrounded by boulders of different sizes, and you can climb to the top of them with a little effort to get a stunning view of the entire city and the geography. It is located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River. Famous for its massive, beautifully carved temples, especially the Virupaksha Temple, dedicated to the patron deity of the empire. You can also find remains of the old aqueducts, canals and military barracks and stables here. Hampi was declared a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1986 and many efforts have been taken to restore the lost glory of the place - very limited (if any) modern establishments are allowed in the main area, which gives an authentic feel to the ruins.

     	<p>
     		The first settlements in Hampi date back to 1 CE. The Emperor Ashoka’s Rock Edicts indicate that the region was once under Mauryan influence. A terracotta sealing and a Brahmi inscription have been recovered from the excavation site. Both belong to the 2nd century CE. The historically and architecturally dominated site has also been besieged by the Deccan Muslim Sultanate. The Vijayanagara Empire had a heavy flow of trade with Hampi being the main centre. Due to this many Hindu and Muslim rulers were attracted towards the small town. Different rules and different empires have resulted in the vibrant culture of people of Hampi. The ancient town has its fame for its archaeological importance. The ruins, concert halls, bazaars, and boulders speak of the greatness of  Vijayanagara Empire.

     	<center><h1 id="q1">Qutub Minar</h1></center>
     	<p>
     	   Standing tall and proud as the insignia of the Mughal might and dominion, Qutub Minar is an iconic monument which spells out the narrative of Delhi like no other. It forms a part of the Qutub Complex comprising the Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, Alai Darwaza, Alai Minar, Ala-ud-din's Madrasa and Tomb, Iron Pillar, Tomb of Imam Zamin, Sanderson's Sundial and Major Smith's Cupola. The tallest brick minaret in the world is said to have been designed on the lines of Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan. Situated in Mehrauli - the heritage storehouse of Delhi, the site is also the venue for the annual three-day Qutub Festival - a gathering of musicians, artistes, and dancers.
     	</p><br>
     	<center><h3 id="q2">History</h3></center>
     	<p>
     		Delhi’s Qutub Minar is a five-storied structure constructed over four centuries by a number of rulers. It was originally commissioned by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who was the founder of the Delhi Sultanate, around 1192 as a victory tower. The minaret is named after him; although he wasn’t able to build it beyond the first story. His successor Shams-ud-din Iltutmish added three more floors to the structure in 1220. Its topmost story suffered damages in 1369 due to lightning. It was reconstructed by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, who added the fifth and final story to the tower while the entrance to Qutub Minar was built by Sher Shah Suri.
     	</p><br>
     	<center><h3 id="q3">Height and Architecture</h3></center>
     	<p>
     		The magnificent Qutub Minar has a height of 73 meters. It has a base diameter of 14.3 meters which narrows down to 2.7 meters at the top. The structure also includes a spiral staircase of 379 steps. There are many other historical edifices around the minaret which, together with the main tower, form the Qutub Minar Complex.

            It is widely believed that the tower, which displays early Afghan architectural style, was built taking inspiration from the Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan. Each of the five distinct stories of the minaret is adorned with a projecting balcony supported by intricately designed brackets. While the first three stories are built in pale red sandstone, the fourth one is purely made of marble, and the fifth one is a mix of marble and sandstone. The architectural styles from the base to the top also differ, thanks to the many rulers who constructed it part by part.
